# Project 4:- World Bank Data
**Objective:**
Explore the realm of data visualization in Python by utilizing powerful libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. The task is to create visually engaging and informative plots, graphs, and charts based on a provided dataset.
  
##  **World Bank Data**

In 2006, Hans Rosling gave a TED talk titled The best stats you've ever seen. At the beginning of the talk, he showed an animation he made to debunk some misconceptions about today's world.
  
  (Must watch this video before working on the project https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen ).

I enjoyed seeing this visualisation and I want you to reproduce it with the tools you know (i.e. Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn and Matplotlib). 
## **Dataset Information**
1. **Life expectancy at birth:** The number of years a newborn would live if the patterns of mortality at the time of birth remain the same throughout his life.


2. **Fertility rate:** Number of children a woman would give birth to during her childbearing years. 


3. **Country population:** Total number of residents regardless of legal status or citizenship (midyear estimates)
   
Hans Rosling built this animation, after testing his students on global health, he realised that they still thought that the world was divided in two:
The Western world: low fertility rate and high life expectancy
The third world: high fertility rate and low life expectancy
